### What is Uni–Form 

Uni-Form is a framework that standardizes form markup and styles it with CSS 
giving you two most widely used layout options to choose from. Anyone can get nice 
looking, well structured, highly customizable, accessible and usable forms. To put 
it simply: it makes a developer's life a lot easier. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to Use? 

First thing you need to do is to link up the necessary files: 

    * Link up the main CSS file
    
      <link href="path/to/file/uni-form.css" media="all" rel="stylesheet"/>
    
    * Link up the Uni–Form style CSS file
      
      <link href="path/to/file/default.uni-form.css" media="all" rel="stylesheet"/>
    
    * Optionally you'll want to link up jQuery and Uni–Form jQuery files if you'd 
      like Uni–Form to highlight the form rows on focus (it's a usability aid): 
      
      <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4/jquery.min.js"></script>
      <script src="path/to/file/uni-form.jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script> 

Now that you're all set up, all you need to do is add form fields that are formatted
with Uni–Form markup so the CSS and JavaScript will get the “hooks” they need. These
chunks of code are called “units” and all available units can be found within the 
file called fauxform.html that is included in this package. 

Feel free to extend Uni–Form with units of your own and share. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Styles 

As of v1.4 Uni–Form supports styles. These are separate CSS files that contain the
presentation aspect of your form (considering that uni-form.css) contains the 
layout. Style CSS files should be used to control how your form looks, spacing… 

Sharing styles is encouraged, and by default Uni–Form is shipped with three: 

    * Default
    * Blue 
    * Dark 
    
Consider these a starting point for making your own. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Options and Layout Control 

Uni–Form by default has two form layouts: default and inline. This is controlled 
by adding (or removing) a CSS class .inlineLabels to the fieldset element. 

There is another option in regards to the layout and it concerns what is referred 
to as “multifields”. These are fields that contain multiple inputs per unit and 
are usually used for checkboxes and radio buttons. Each layout supports an 
alternate multifield layout. This is achieved by adding (or removing) a CSS class
.alternate to the ul element. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Events

Triggering an error event on the form fields will apply the error
class to the controller and overwrite the supplied description of that
controller with the error text, an example would be:

$(selector).trigger('error',['an error occured']);

Subsequent calls to success on the form field will remove the error
and replace the error text with the originally supplied description,
an example:

$(selector).trigger('success');

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Form Validation

Uni–Form can be used with the included uni-form-validation.js file for client
side validation. This is accomplished by using class names on the form elements
to trigger validation rules on blur(). It must be noted that these validation rules
should be used to supplement a server side solution.

Required element, cannot be empty:
  <input type="text" class="textInput required" />

Integer with value greater than or equal to 8:
  <input type="text" class="textInput validateInteger validateMin val-8" />

Available validators:
  required
  validateMinLength
  validateMin
  validateMaxLength
  validateMax
  validateSameAs
  validateEmail
  validateUrl
  validateNumber
  validateInteger
  validateAlpha
  validateAlphaNum
  validatePhrase
  validatePhone
  validateDate
  validateCallback

Validators what require a parameter, such as validateMinLength, take that
parameter as a class name following the validator in the format of 
"val-{value}".
