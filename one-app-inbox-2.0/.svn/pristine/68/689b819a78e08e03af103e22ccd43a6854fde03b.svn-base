Software patents are an unnecessary evil. Use this however you like. 
don't even think about trying to sue me because it causes your application to 
explode or just not work somehow. I'd appraciate credit where it is due, and to 
see any improvements you make, but I won't be hurt if it doesn't happen.

enjoy :)
